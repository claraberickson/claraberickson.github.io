    <h1>Lovebird</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>Lovebird is the common name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">Genus</a> Agapornis, a small group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot">parrots</a> in the Old World parrot family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittaculidae">Psittaculidae</a>. Of the nine species in the genus, all are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to the African island of Madagascar.</p>
    <p>Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots' strong, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy">Monogamy</a> pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses, and seeds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_lovebird">Black-winged lovebird</a> also eat insects and figs, and black-collared lovebirds have a special dietary requirement for native figs, making them problematic to keep in captivity.</p>
    <p>Some species are kept as pets, and several coloured mutations have been selectively bred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviculture">aviculture</a>. The average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.</p>

    <p> Lovebirds are 13 to 17 cm (5 to 7 in) in length, up to 24 cm in wingspan with 9 cm for a single wing and 40 to 60 g (1+1‚ÅÑ2 to 2 oz) in weight. They are among the smallest parrots, characterised by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak. Wildtype lovebirds are mostly green with a variety of colours on their upper body, depending on the species. The Fischer's lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the masked lovebird have a prominent white ring around their eyes. Many colour mutant varieties have been produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding">Selective breeding</a> of the species that are popular in aviculture.</p>
