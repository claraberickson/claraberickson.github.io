    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>Lovebird is the common name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">Genus</a> Agapornis, a small group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot">parrots</a> in the Old World parrot family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittaculidae">Psittaculidae</a>. Of the nine species in the genus, all are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to the African island of Madagascar.</p>
    <p>Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots' strong, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy">Monogamy</a> pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses, and seeds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_lovebird">Black-winged lovebird</a> also eat insects and figs, and black-collared lovebirds have a special dietary requirement for native figs, making them problematic to keep in captivity.</p>
    <p>Some species are kept as pets, and several coloured mutations have been selectively bred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviculture">aviculture</a>. The average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.</p>

    <p> Lovebirds are 13 to 17 cm (5 to 7 in) in length, up to 24 cm in wingspan with 9 cm for a single wing and 40 to 60 g (1+1⁄2 to 2 oz) in weight. They are among the smallest parrots, characterised by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak. Wildtype lovebirds are mostly green with a variety of colours on their upper body, depending on the species. The Fischer's lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the masked lovebird have a prominent white ring around their eyes. Many colour mutant varieties have been produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding">Selective breeding</a> of the species that are popular in aviculture.</p>

    <p>The genus Agapornis was introduced by the English naturalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prideaux_John_Selby">Prideaux John Selby</a> in 1836.[2] The name combines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek">Ancient Greek</a> αγάπη agape meaning "love" and όρνις ornis meaning "bird".[3] The type species is the black-collared lovebird (Agapornis swindernianus).[4] The genus contains nine species of which five are monotypic and four are divided into subspecies. They are native to mainland Africa and the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. In the wild, the different species are separated geographically.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, lovebirds are divided into three groups:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the sexually dimorphic species: Madagascar, Abyssinian, and red-headed lovebird</li>
      <li>the intermediate species: peach-faced lovebird</li>
      <li>the white-eye-ringed species: masked, Fischer's, Lilian's, and black-cheeked lovebirds</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, this division is not fully supported by phylogenetic studies, as the species of the dimorphic group are not grouped together in a single clade.</p>

    <p>Depending on the species of lovebird, the female will carry nesting material into the nest in various ways. The peach-faced lovebird tucks nesting material in the feathers of its rump,[8] while the masked lovebird carries nesting material back in its beak. Once the lovebirds start constructing their nest, mating will follow. During this time, the lovebirds will mate repeatedly. Eggs follow 3–5 days later. The female will spend hours inside her nesting box before eggs are laid. Once the first egg is laid, a new egg will follow every other day until the clutch is complete, typically at four to six eggs. Even without a nest or a male, lovebirds sometimes produce eggs.</p>
